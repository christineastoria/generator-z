# Gen‑Z Styled Image Captioner

This project is a web service that generates social-media‑style captions (Gen‑Z tone, slang, brevity) for images—designed to help creators get more engagement with fresh, trendy captions.

## Features

- Accepts an image input and outputs a Gen‑Z style caption  
- Emphasizes slang, brevity, and trendy tone  
- Optionally allows “mood” or “tone” prompts (e.g. “funny”, “aesthetic”, “vibe”)  
- Handles image features like brightness, objects, emotions to inform caption  

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- Backend: Python with image processing + LLM caption generation  
- Model: Vision‑language model (e.g. CLIP + prompt engineering or a multimodal LLM)  
- API: Exposed via a web framework like FastAPI (or a serverless function)  
- Frontend (optional): Simple web form or React component to upload & display caption  

---

## Usage

### 1. Run the server
```bash
# install dependencies (example)
pip install fastapi uvicorn pillow requests transformers
```

Start the API:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. POST to the API
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/caption"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{"image_url":"https://example.com/photo.jpg", "tone":"aesthetic"}'
```

### 3. Example response
```json
{
  "caption": "sunlight hitting my skin, golden glow vibes"
}
```

### 4. Frontend usage
A small UI can allow users to upload or paste an image URL, select a tone, click “Generate,” and see the caption appear.

## Dataset & Training

- (If applicable) used an image-caption dataset (e.g. COCO, Flickr30k)  
- Fine-tuned with style transfer / prompt tuning to infuse Gen‑Z slang  
- May use pseudo-labeling or filters to enforce tone  

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Style may lean stereotypical or repetitive  
- Mislabels on out-of-distribution images  
- Better multimodal models (e.g. GPT‑4V) could improve quality  
- Add user controls (“less slang”, “longer caption”)  
- UI gallery for caption suggestions and edits  

---

## Why this Project

The goal is to make content creation more fun and accessible. Many creators struggle to come up with trendy, catchy captions — this tool automates that in a style-forward way.
