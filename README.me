# Gen‑Z Styled Image Captioner

This project is a web service that generates social-media‑style captions (Gen‑Z tone, slang, brevity) for images—designed to help creators get more engagement with fresh, trendy captions.

## Features

- Accepts an image input and outputs a Gen‑Z style caption  
- Emphasizes slang, brevity, randomness and trendy tone  
- Handles image features like brightness, objects, emotions to inform caption  

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack

- Backend: Python with image processing and plain captioning using GPT2, fine tuned GPT-J LLM caption generation using 5-shot prompt
- Model: Vision‑language model (GPT-2 Image captioner, 5 shot prompting to fine-tuned GPT-J)  
- Frontend: [Streamlit app](https://gracealwan-genz-image-captioner-gen-z-image-captioner-08dumi.streamlit.app/)

## Usage
[Streamlit app](https://gracealwan-genz-image-captioner-gen-z-image-captioner-08dumi.streamlit.app/)

## Dataset & Training

- Used existing plain image caption model GPT-2
- Fine-tuned GPT-J with scraped instagram captions of over 1000+ Gen-Z posts
- Increased randomness as hyperaparameter for Gen-Z slang

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Style may lean stereotypical or repetitive/over fit examples in fine tuning
- Mislabels on out-of-distribution images  
- Better multimodal models (e.g. GPT‑4V) could improve quality  
- Add user controls (“less slang”, “longer caption”)  
- UI gallery for caption suggestions and edits

## Why this Project

Most ML image captioners simply describe the image and don't use the image contents to come up with stylized captions. This goal was to combine vision and langugae prompting to make content creation more fun and accessible. Many creators struggle to come up with trendy, catchy captions — this tool automates that in a style-forward way.
